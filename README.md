This README is for HW 4. Group members: Clement Leung, Jian Hao Miao



### How did we approached the assignement? ###

We tried out everything we thought would work and adjusted from there until we got things working.  

### How we tested it ###

We used the test script and ran some its commands individually for testing. We also used curl commands to check for instances
where the program breaks



## Webiste Sources we used to help write hw 4 files

Stack overflow on questions related to dict and list manipulation in Python, as well as the Docker documentations to check for any Docker issues we may come across.
